# Fetching, Building and Installing V8 (On Ubuntu 16.04 x64 or later)

The following instructions fetch the Google V8 JavaScript engine to your local machine, configure it to create static libraries, and install the resulting artifacts to the location where the Multichain build system expects to find them.

Multichain uses V8 version 6.8, and requires at least 4 GB of RAM to build in a reasonable time. It will not build at all with less than 2 GB RAM.

## Install dependencies

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install git python pkg-config build-essential
    
## Clone Google's depot_tools

Google's [depot_tools](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools) are used by the Google build system to manage Git checkouts.

    git clone --depth=1 https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
    export PATH=${PATH}:$(pwd)/depot_tools
    
## Fetch V8

The following commands check out V8 and select the branch used by Multichain. Please note that this step downloads about 2 GB of data, and can take a long time (30 minutes or more).

    gclient
    fetch v8
    cd v8
    git checkout 6.8-lkgr

## Configure V8

The V8 build system currently uses a proprietary version of the Ninja build system, called GN. It is part of the `depot_tools` installed earlier.

    find . -name BUILD.gn -exec sed -i '/exe_and_shlib_deps/d' {} \;
    tools/dev/v8gen.py x64.release
    RELEASE=out.gn/x64.release
    cat > $RELEASE/args.gn << END
    is_debug = false
    target_cpu = "x64"
    is_component_build = false
    v8_static_library = true
    use_custom_libcxx = false
    use_custom_libcxx_for_host = false
    END
    
    gn gen $RELEASE

## Build and install V8 

The Ninja command builds the V8 libraries and data files. The installation location (`${HOME}/local/v8`) is currently hard-coded into the Multichain build system. This will change soon in a future Alpha release.

    ninja -C $RELEASE
    
    LIB_DIR=${RELEASE}/obj
    PREFIX=${HOME}/local/v8
    
    pushd ${LIB_DIR}
    mkdir full
    for lib in libv8*.a;
        do ar -t $lib | xargs ar rvs $lib.new && mv -v $lib.new full/$lib;
    done
    cd third_party/icu
    mkdir full
    for lib in *.a;
        do ar -t $lib | xargs ar rvs $lib.new && mv -v $lib.new full/$lib;
    done
    popd
    
    rm -rf $PREFIX
    mkdir -p $PREFIX/include/libplatform $PREFIX/lib $PREFIX/data
    install -m 644 -vt $PREFIX/include include/*.h
    install -m 644 -vt $PREFIX/include/libplatform include/libplatform/*.h
    install -m 644 -vt $PREFIX/lib $LIB_DIR/full/libv8*.a $LIB_DIR/third_party/icu/full/*.a
    install -vt $PREFIX/data $RELEASE/*.bin $RELEASE/icudtl.dat
